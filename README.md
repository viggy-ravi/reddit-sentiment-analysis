# reddit_sentiment_analysis

Written by: Vignesh Ravindranath

In this project, I will explore the sentiment of the most/least popular topics and authors from the `r/worldnews` subreddit to understand the behavior of readers. 
The dataset contains information on the new article `title`, `date_created`, `author`, `up_votes`, and if `over_18` (NSFW). 
The purpose of the project is to gain experience with natural language processing tools, such as `nltk`, `VADER`, and regular expressions.

The project consists of:

  1) Exploratory Data Analysis
  2) Creation of Text Features and Tools (sentiment, key words, search engine)
  3) Sentiment Analysis
